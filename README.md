# Module-1-Challenge
# <Horiseon Social Media Agency>

## Description

The Horiseon Social Media Agency challenge provided me the opportunity to make the webpage more accessable; this is done to aid those with disabilities. Codes were altered to be easier to read and bugs were fixed within some elements both in CSS and HTML.

Many/most of the changes were made in the Index.html file. Some div elements (non-descriptive) were change to semantic elements (descriptive). A header, nav element and footer were added along with alt attributes. 

Changes were made in the CSS code so that the HTML flow followed the CSS, in turn, the code overall was easier to read horizontally. Also changes in CSS were made so that styling elements we changed to semantic elements; alterations were made to make sure they worked properly.

## Installation
1. Title was changed to a better suiting title for the context.
2. Alt attributes were added in HTML images and icons to aid those with disabilities.
3. Header, footer, and nav were added in place of div to ensure a better outline of the HTML.
4. Some class elements were altered between the CSS and HTML as well as descriptions added to both to make them easier to follow.
